But even when I do sit down to play, it's easier and more fun because she's contained, and so she's not distracted by whatever else is way across on the other side of the room that just might be more interesting!! BUT, BUY TWO & PUT THEM TOGETHER, & you will get a very good-sized play area (about 6X8 feet, depending on how you shape it) in which you & your child can easily play together (even with a bunch of toys all over AND adding Dad or Grandma!)  Oh, & it is RIDICULOUSLY easy to put together & even move from room to room if you need to!\n",

My only complaint was the sizing. I wish there was some in between sizes or adjustable snaps. I got the 6-18 months and my son is very large but it was still big. So maybe some adjustable snaps would solve that problem.\n",

      "I have 15-month-old twins. Since starting them on solid foods, we've tried about a dozen different bibs from Safety 1st, Bumkins, Ikea, Tommee Tippee (our current favorite), and many other brands I don't recall because the bibs have been thrown away. The Bumkins bibs are better than average, but they're still not great.The tiny piece of velcro doesn't work to keep the bib on. My daughters figured out how to get these bibs off within a week of owning them. I tried for a while to use safety pins instead of the velcro, but it was hard to force the pin into the velcro/fabric, and awkward to have a sharp pin by the babies' necks Now, if I resort to using these bibs, I secure them in back with a bag-clip.The pocket caught about half the spilled food when the girls were just eating purees, but catches virtually nothing now that they're eating finger foods. So, spilled food just rolls down the bib and onto their clothes (and everything else).On the positive side, these bibs are completely washable (shockingly - to me at least - many other bibs aren't really washable and don't dry well -- we've thrown out many bibs because they smelled nasty despite washing & drying anyway we could). The pattern also doesn't wear off (again, this sounds like a low measure of success, but most bibs we've tried had ink that came off on the girls' clothing & hands within the first few uses).Overall, these aren't great -- but they're better than some alternatives.\n",

      "These diapers are easy to use and have worked well for our baby who is now 6 months. Not sure if I would use on newborn, we started after he was 6 weeks old of so--they are a bit bulky on tiny ones.Hemp liners are thinner and help with bulk.\n",

      "I have 3 of these cups in both sizes used by my 2 year old and 1 year old.  The cups are very cute and I like how you can tuck the straw away with a twist of the lid, though my 2 year old can not untwist or twist the lid herself.  But these cups leak alot!  If one is lying on it's side it will always be in a puddle of liquid.  Small children don't always put their cups down upright.  And with one of them (a pink 7 oz), the lid comes completely off when it is dropped!  Even when the straw is concealed there is still a slow leak.  It is easy for children to drink from and this was the first sippy that my youngest could use successfully.\n",

      "I got this for my toddler to reach the sink. It doesn't quite get her there so it's not useful now. She's used it a few time and tipped off of it, scraping her legs with the under edge of the stool.  For the price (ten bucks), its fine.  Good grips on top and grippers on the legs. The eyes are actually holes which make it easier for my daughter to pick up and move it.\n",

      "We purchased this for our (then) 15 month old for a short 3 hour road trip. When we pass him a snack, he either drops it or it ends up between his legs in his carseat, so we thought this would help.  This worked so well, and he kept himself busy (for 10 minutes) :) by naming everything he could see, or pointing to it when asked.It was a little difficult to clasp it onto our carseat, luckily the removeable carseat cover stretched just enough to make it a snug fit.After about 30 minutes though, he'd find a way to pull his knees up an make it fall towards his feet.That being said, we use it occaisionally for trips across town and it works great.\n",

      "We have the Baby Jogger City Mini and the Chicco Keyfit 30.  We loved this product.  This allows us to use our stroller like the traditional, cluckier, and heavier car seat stroller travel systems. This was very easy to assemble and disassemble.  I loved how high the car seat is compared to traditional travel systems.  You don't have to bend over very much or at all to talk to your baby or take care of his needs, which is great for someone with back problems.  Additionally, your baby has a higher vantage point to look around, and we felt made him seem more included in what we were doing.As other reviewers have noted:You can fold up your baby jogger as normal (just go under the attachment to reach the pull), but it will be a bit bulkier with the attachment sticking up.  However, this was never really much of an issue for us.  Without the car seat, it is just the bars sticking up.We did have issues with the seat not automatically clicking into place when placed in the adaptor.  Most times, one side would click and the other would still be loose.  A simple check we did was pull up slightly on each side, if the seat moved up then we knew we would have to try again.  We would just have to release the seat and attach again. Granted, we would usually have to do this a few times before both sides would be secure (sometimes, it would work on the first try!).  However, the benefits of the adaptor far outweighed the inconvenience!\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, I wish we had NEVER had this thing.I'm so on the fence about it, that I'm going to start with the cons, which I believe are serious enough to warn parents!a.  All these reviews about flat heads?  I didn't believe them.  Just like many of you reading these reviews are questioning the whole flat head thing, just like I did, and ignoring that advice.  How wrong I was. . .please don't ignore those warnings! ! !Guess what?  Our LO has a horrible flat spot, and I'm 100% positive it's from this.  We believe 'carseats are for the car', so our baby is in our arms or in a wrap and held upright all of the time - we NEVER use the carseat as a carrier, we only use the swing for playtime save a few days here and there where I needed to be doing something other than holding him while he napped.  He sat unassisted at 4 months, and at 5 months can be left to sit by himself on the floor (this is early) because we have concentrated SO hard on keeping him out of that laying position provided by carseats and swings and bouncers.  He gets plenty of tummy time and there is absolutely no other reason that he should have a flat spot but for the few hours (2-5) he has spent in the RnP Sleeper each night.  I had even stuffed a few receiving blankets in between the frame and the cover, to no avail.  The flat spot on his head is exactly where the RnP sleeper hits him - for this reason alone, I absolutely caution against the use of this, even minimally.b.  Our baby is 5 months old.  He has spent the first part of the evening (usually 2-5 hours or so) in the RnP and then is moved into our bed because he likes to comfort nurse overnight, laying on his side next to me.  This child WILL NOT sleep on a flat surface now unless I'm snuggled up with him!  The transition to the crib has been very very difficult - and unfortunately, he is not only outgrowing the RnP but the flat spot is making it necessary that we make this move. It's a 'do or die' situation and I believe that if our LO had been used to sleeping in a bassinet instead of this device, the transition would be much much easier.c.  Unlike a bassinet, you have to belt your child into this thing when they reach a certain level of activity - by 3 months, our LO would try and pick his butt up. . .not cool. . .so we had to start using the belt.  This is VERY very tricky when you are trying to get your LO to STAY ASLEEP! ! !  Again, I'm wishing we had just used a bassinet I could put him down in and be done. . .Ok. . .so the pros. . .a.  LO is very comfy/cozy in the RnPb.  For the first few months, it was nice while I took a shower he would hang out and nap or look at a toy.  By 2 months, however, he was happier playing on the floor on a blanket (within view of the shower) or in the Jumpy hung from the doorway of the bathroom (4 months+).c.  Ummm. . .it's cheaper than a bassinet.  But, given what I know now, I wish we'd just bought a traditional bassinet.The new My Little Lamb RnP looks amazing, I will admit, and will likely help with the flat spot.  But imagine your child being used to sleeping in that, and then try and get him/her to sleep in a wide open flat crib!?  Good luck.  I recommend not going there. . .\n",

      "For a thin sheet of plastic, I thought $7 was a rip-off. I might as well put a large kitchen garbage bag under the high chair instead for a fraction of that price. Also, it reeked so much of this strong plastic smell when I got it in the mail that I thought it was nauseating. I didn't want it under my baby while he's sniffling all those plastic fumes in. So thanks to free baby returns on Amazon, I returned it and got a rug from Walmart for $14 instead and covers the same area, works like a charm, doesn't stink up the whole area, and looks much better in our dining room.\n",

      "I've used Playtex drop-ins for my two younger kids, and I've been really happy with them. They're BPA-free, the nipple shape seems to work well for breast-fed babies, and the drop-in liner seems to make it easier for them to nurse because you can squeeze all the air out. They also don't seem to leak.I don't know that the drop-ins really save a ton of cleaning; normally, I manage to spill any milk left in the liner all over everything as I\"m taking it out, though I think that's more the fault of my own spectacular clumsiness than any design flaw :)\n",

Maybe the women who liked this pump had smaller nipples than I do. Every time I have used this the rubber pops out. To put it back in you have to completely unscrew the cap and put your fingers in. A bad design and not at all sterile. Do not waste your money. I complained to avent and although they had good customer service and sent me out a new pump, it did exactly the same thing.

      "I've been using it for nearly a year now. I was going to buy the Boss RV-5 when I somehow discovered Biyang. I had never heard of them, but at 1/3 the price of the Boss AND stereo Ins and Outs, I gave it a try and I haven't looked back. The 3 modes are nice. I leave mine set on hall because I've never liked spring reverb, but the spring setting on this pedal does sound exactly like a spring reverb. The decay time in any mode is more than enough for probably anybody, and I can say the same for the blend control. Overall, this is a great pedal with lots of sounds that will suit just about any style of playing. More than enough decay and wetness. Seems well-built. I've since bought other Biyang pedals and I have never had any issues like other reviewers have stated. I'm not ashamed of having Chinese clones on my board.

      "This is a very nice device if you need a camera to watch a baby, child, pet or other family member. I use it to keep an eye on my Dobermans who like to do stupid stuff sometimes when no one is looking. The night vision works pretty well and the temperature reading is a neat feature that can be set to read in Fahrenheit or Celsius. You can talk into the handset if needed, although it sounds kind of loud and harsh.  The battery itself is supposed to be good for 300 charges and is best recharged when it is about to die out. The camera needs to be plugged in all the time to work. As of now, I have left the monitor plugged in since I mostly only need it at my desk. The battery life is not that great if you don't use the auto shutoff. The signal goes out for a second here and there. I am not sure if it is the device or something at my desk causing it.The camera can be adjusted to look up or down and set up was very easy. The instructions included are minimal, but we didn't even need them to get things running. This is a handy little monitor that I am happy with. I may consider purchasing additional cameras for this.\n",

However, the beads pinch the hair at the nape of my neck (when my hair is down or up) and often pulls it out when I remove it or my infant tugs on it.  The necklace hasn't broken yet and my guy hasn't pulled hard enough to engage the clasp release feature (which kind of worries me since he's pulled on it with a lot of force, force I worry might be hard enough to strangle him with if it were entangled around his neck, luckily I don't let him play with it without being in sight).  Overall, great concept and just wonder if the elastic cording could be improved or the bead shape could be improved to prevent this hair plucking issue.

      "This is very convenient color correcting pen for the under eye.  One can use it as a concealer of dark circles.  It can be also used a a part of the makeup application prior to applying foundation.  The most similar to this one I used in a past is YSL brand which is much more expensive and gives no better results that this product.  I absolutely love the brush on the tip of the pen.  It is not made of natural fibers, but fibers are so soft it feels delightful when it touches the skin.  One can easily control how much product to use during the application.  The opposite tip of the pen allows for tint to come towards the brush so it can be applied on the skin.  Pen is very thin and it can be easily stored in a cosmetic bag or a purse.  Tin is not too dark. Pf course ever person has a different skin tone so it may be tricky to know which shade one can use.  But if you are using it under foundation, it really does not matter.  It will only enhance and moisturize under eye area.\n",

We haven't actually used the wrist strap yet, but I wanted to buy a bottle that could be attached to the stroller or my daughter while we're on the go.My 2.5 year old daughter had no probably opening the bottle cap herself and sipping water from the straw. I'm concerned that the cute monkey on the front will probably wear quickly off the bottle. We only plan to use the bottle for water since these contraptions can be difficult to clean. I appreciate that the bottle came with an extra straw too. After this first week of use, I'm still very happy with the purchase.\n",

      "This is my first video monitor but it met all my expectations. I did a lot of research on affordable baby monitors (~$100) and found that they all pretty much do the same thing. I wanted a monitor that I could easily 1) install, 2)hear the baby, and 3) see the baby without having to squint because the monitor was too small. It met all my wants but I wish it has the option to lower the volume even lower. I can hear the sound machine easily at the lowest volume setting and it amplifies every movement and sound that my baby makes. I wouldn't say that I'm a light or heavy sleeper, but i do sometimes wake up just by the sound of my baby turning, or moving in his sleep. And the battery life is not that long. I wouldn't go to sleep without plugging it in because the battery only lasts about 3-4 hours.I like that I can add another video camera in the future and the screen will switch back and forth every 8 seconds without me having to switch it manually. A lot of the video monitor on the market around this price won't have that feature. The zoom seemed like a good feature, but it's pretty useless. And the buttons are all on the side so I do accidentally push them when I grab it but not a big deal to me. I do wish that the quality of the video feed was less grainy. But overall, I would recommend it for the price.\n",

      "I have been using Vichy products for some time and I must say this is a good over the counter line that can be found in most drugstores.  This is the first time that I used their products for full body treatment (in the past, I used daytime and nighttime facial creams).  What is unique for this product is that it is referred to as \"Body Firming Serum Milk\".  Based on the ingredient list, I am not sure how much firming this product provides, but it is a gold mine of the moisturizing ingredients.  I recently came from a trip to Florida.  I normally stay away from the sun, but my skin gets sensitive with even the smallest sun exposure and ocean water.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to mention main ingredients of this product.  It contains: Hyaluronic acid (super moisturizing agent), LHA, and a combination of the carrier oils: jojoba oil (that is super absorbent to the skin because its molecular structure is the closest to the molecular structure of the skin), sunflower oil, rosehip oil that is known for healing properties of the skin and apricot oil that  also has faint pleasing scent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next important thing to mention is the texture of this product.  This is definitely not a milk, because you will find product is not runny at all.  It is also not a traditional lotion, because it appears to be thicker than lotion and thinner than cream.  Perhaps because of the ingredients, product spreads on the skin easily and does not live thick residue.  It absorbs almost instantaneously and will not leave stains on the clothing like some of the body locations.  So for these reasons it is totally appropriate to call this product a serum.  It is almost a form of moisturizing primer for the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally the size of the product.  This is  a generous size product and it will last for 2-3 months if used daily.  I personally use it every morning after shower.  I recently restarted practicing Baptiste style hot yoga.  I sweat a lot during and after practice and it is important for my skin to rehydrate on the regular basis to avoid flaking.  This is a perfect product and my skin loves it.  It is good for sensitive skin and it will not aggravate it.  I also like the pump that bottle uses.  Pump allows me to be in control how much product I wish to use, which is not always the case with the oils.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unfortunate that bottle has pink color, so it gives impression that is only good for women.

      "This stuff feels really good on my skin! This was the first time that I have tried AHAVA Dead Sea Essentials products. The witch hazel cream smells very clean and makes my skin feel good. It has a very creamy feel to it, and a little bit goes a LONG way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first applied it, it felt greasy. I was afraid to touch anything for fear of leaving residue on the things around me. However, it didn't take long to soak in. At that point, my skin felt like it had a coating, almost like silicone, but of course it was all natural. Moisture was locked in and my skin felt very soft.\n",

      "The scent is soft and clean smelling, not too perfumey, and it's not overpowering. I keep smelling my hands because they smell so good. I'd love to buy this in a body cream. I imagine it would be perfect to treat dry winter skin. I'm already a fan!\n",

      "I did a ton of research on bottles, and ended up almost more confused afterwards.  Everyone likes a different bottle, and many of the reviews consist of whether their baby liked a particular bottle, which is not that helpful.  Although I will detail my reasons below, overall I thought this was a really well-designed, easy to use bottle which manages to be anti-colic without a lot of parts (which either makes the bottle hard to clean or prone to leaks).BTW I cannot speak to whether it is good for breastfeeding babies, since I do only formula.  Since this was developed by Similac, it is very well designed for formula-feeding.  So here's what I liked about this bottle:1.  Simple and easy to use.  There are not a zillion parts, and yet it is anti-colic due to the vent in the nippple (similar to Tommee Tippee bottles).  I'm not sure if this is the most effective anti-colic system on the market, but my baby is doing really well with it.  Easy to clean in the dishwasher as well.2.  No more formula clumps.  It has a mixer paddle which hangs into the bottle, and shaking the bottle causes the paddle to move back and forth to fully mix the formula.  I remember the clumping problem from the Avent bottles in the past, and I love this feature.  However, if you don't use formula or hate the extra piece (which sits easily in the bottle and dishwashers), it is easily removable as well3.  Cap that seals well but also removes easily.  I tried the MAM bottles, and could barely get the caps off (a problem for anyone who has arthritis especially, such as a grandmother).  I once handed one to my husband to remove the cap for me, and he immediately reached for the flat screwdriver.4.  Can buy additional caps which can hold powdered formula for travel/putting in the diaper bag.  You fill the bottle with the desired number of ounces of water, screw on the nipple and ring, and then replace the usual cap with the special formula-containing cap (which you fill with the right number of scoops of formula).  They are generously sized (unlike Tommee Tippee formula holders), so you can use them as the child gets older and needs more formula at a feeding.  No more buying separate formula dispensers, and it keeps the formula attached to the bottle.5.  No leaks!  If you have screwed the nipple ring on correctly, you'll see two blue triangles in the windows of the nipple ring.  I had problems with the Avent bottles frequently when we'd screw on the nipple and ring, but accidentally have misaligned the grooves.  You'd start to shake the bottle to mix it, and end up with milk all over you and the baby.  I did have one or two times where it leaked when I shook the bottle, which I learned was due to an improperly seated nipple.  I now check to make sure the nipple is seated properly when I pre-assemble the bottles, but this is easy to do.The only thing I don't like is that the nipple is so soft, it doesn't seat as easily as firmer nipples do in the nipple ring.  It's not quite as soft as Tommee Tippee (which I found impossible to place), and I got used to it very quickly.  A lot of people praise the soft nipple for breastfeeding babies, though, so it may have advantages.\n",

      "the socks do not stay on my daughter's chubbilicious feet. At four months she has just started grabbing her little tootsies and these feet-finders are super cute but 1, aren't shaped like a sock to accommodate the heel and consequently come off rather easily and 2, are a bit tight (but dont seem to have any elasticity to them) and are hard to keep pulling back on my baby's feet.\n",

      "Pricey for what it does.Storage/space issues: For a cramped freezer or refrigerator, this 4-cup tray is fine. The oz., ml and tsp measurements etched onto the silicone cups could be useful. The uppermost marks etched on the sides of the cup are 2oz., 60ml. and 12tsp. For my 7-month-old who started solids only a month ago, these cups hold more than enough food for each meal; he only stomachs about 1oz of food after having his fill of breastmilk.Storage uses: I've used these for defrosting and storing individual servings of pureed food that's been frozen in cubes. I haven't tried freezing food with these yet, but it is nice to know that I can. The Munchkin packaging recommends that you \"remove lids and fill cups with baby food. Insert cups into tray and place tray in freezer. To thaw, let stand in refrigerator.\" It's not clear that you can screw the lids back on before putting the filled cups into the freezer. Maybe there's a concern that the expansion of the baby food in the freezer will cause the lids to pop out and wreck the threads. I don't know.Cleaning/maintenance: For those lucky enough to have a dishwashing machine, these are dishwasher safe, top rack only. The three parts can be washed separately. The silicone cup easily pops out of the white collar, and the lid unscrews. Bits of food that somehow get stuck in the crevices can be cleaned off this way. The cup openings are wide enough for me to clean using bottle brushes, or soft sponges. As for staining issues, I've stored pureed avocado, parsnips, and butternut squash, and so far, the silicone, white collar and lids remain clear. When my kid moves onto beets, I'll update my review on the staining issue.Transporting (i.e., any leakage?): The lids screw on tightly, very tightly if you want. There is an arrow (and the word \"close\") on the lid indicating how tightly you can screw the cup shut, but I never screw the lids on that much because I'd have a hard time unscrewing them back open. I've stored purees only in these so far. Nothing's leaked despite being lax about transporting them upright or across smooth roads.However, there is a slight leakage risk: If you fill them with liquid only, the tight lids don't prevent leaks. I noticed they do leak a little bit when they're shaken vigorously. It looks like liquid seeps out when the silicone cup is not carefully positioned into the white collar (there are two tiny notches to guide the fitting of these two components). If you squeeze the silicone cups - which is easy to do since the material is so pliable - you could inadvertently cause the cup to detach from the white collar and thus, the liquid to leak.Serving: These cups are about the right size for me to hold in one hand while the other hand spoons the food out or wipes away messes. They're soft and grip-able too, so if my baby had less of a knack for flinging things across the room, he might be able to hold onto these cups and feed himself without splattering his poor old mom. However, even if he were to fling these cups across the room, nothing would shatter. My heart might shatter at the sight of him throwing away the food I slaved in the kitchen to make, but that doesn't reflect on this product's construction.Other notes on materials and construction: BPA free, and although I know the cup is made of silicone, the packaging doesn't say what the white collar or lid is made of. The silicone cups are clear enough for me to see what's inside and how much of it is left (or how defrosted the baby food puree is), although it would be nice if the lid had a clear window so I can quickly see the contents from the top. If you care about where this product was manufactured, this product is made in China.Price: Minus one star due to the cost of this product. For this price, I wish these cups were entirely leak-proof or that they'd come in batches of six. Or both! The price is a major factor keeping me from buying another set right now. The other factor is I'm eyeing a similar product that will be released soon by OXO.\n",

      "I already had the girl pack, but these are so useful and so good, I wanted more. So I came and got this pack in order to have more variety of colors. Below is my original review for the girl pack:&#34;My baby has a little bit of reflux and she's ALWAYS spitting. Not only after feedings, but sometimes even two hours after feeding we have some spitting episodes. So of course she is ALWAYS wearing a bib. What I loved about this:- Ten pack of great solid colors, now the bibs are accessories that she wears with her outfits, not ugly items she HAS to wear.- Now she has enough bibs for two days, at least.- Waterproof lining, so it prevents her clothes from getting wet.- The lining is SO thin I can't tell it is there. I have other bibs with waterproof lining that are thick and we can hear the plastic inside.- Double sided very absorbent surfaces. With milk I don't use the two sides, becaue the milk starts to smell bad after a while (I'm very picky about smells, I can smell from far away - my husband calls me a troll, hehe) but if it is just saliva (she can't seem to stop sucking her hands lately) I can totally put one bib to dry and after a while use the other side, if I'm out of bibs.- Green company! Found out only after purchase.- 3-12 months old size (found out only after purchase), which is perfect because my baby turned three months two days ago, so she'll use them for a long time!Love them!&#34;\n",

      "We have a Baby Trend playard (in Columbia) and recently purchased the 38x26x3 inchDream On Me 3\" Playard Mattress, Whitewhich fits in the playard perfectly. TheCarters Quilted Woven Playard Fitted Sheet, Sagewe had been using and love doesn't come close to fitting the mattress. The Carter's sheet does fit the thin mattress that originally came with the playard, although it is very snug and compressed the mattress length after a lot of use. I'm trying to give specifics to help others who are looking for sheets to fit whatever playard and mattress they have.Anyway, I bought this sheet in hopes that it would fit our mattress. It does, although it is very tight. It might compress the foam mattress after lots of use, although I'm thinking the foam mattress should hold up against a tight sheet a lot better than the cardboard-y sectioned mattress that came with the playard. The sheet is very soft and thick and doesn't get really cold like some sheets. It is, however, 100% polyester for those of you wishing to only have 100% cotton against your baby's skin. It's a nice green just like in the picture. It looks brand new after the one wash I've given it and did not shrink (I air dried it to be safe). Besides preferring cotton, my only complaint is that it is so tight, but if I was using this on the playard mattress which is what it's made for it would be perfect, a better fit than the Carter's woven sheet.\n",

She cut her two bottom teeth at 5 1/2 months and now at 6 1/2 months, I think her top two are bothering her.  She really seems to enjoy chewing on the soft bristles.  I also give this to her after her meals in the highchair to keep her occupied a little while longer, but also to clean her teeth following the meal.  It is hard to do all the things they tell us to as far as wiping their gums or brushing their new little teeth, so this makes it easy for me and fun and soothing for her.

      "This swing was okay at first, but now we've replaced it with a Fisher Price swing and like it MUCH better. First of all, the mobile on this swing began to lean really far forward and back and never quite stayed in place. Also, over time this swing has taken longer and longer to reach the desired speed. You can imagine that this is quite annoying when trying to soothe an impatient fussy baby! Also, at only 3 months my daughter is too long for this swing. It is also quite annoying that there are three buttons you have to push in order to completely turn the swing off. I don't know how many times we've forgotten to turn off the vibration which runs out the battery really fast. I will say that I like all of the white noise options it has. My daughter also really loved the music.\n",

I'm not sure what they could do to fix the issue I have but sometimes when I'm putting the wipes back I have a hard time situating it correctly so it slides in the holder. It slides into the top restraint easily enough but  the bottom pocket is what gives me the problem. It's not hard and really not the big of a deal. I would still say to go ahead and buy this, I just wish there was a better way to put them back. Maybe two strips along the sides of the holder so it would help direct it down into the bottom pocket?

      "Our son is 4 months old, and we were looking for a play pad that would prevent his head and knees from getting too injured as he learns to crawl and walk, and would provide him a nice play space in the family room.This pad has a nice cushion-y feel and is about a 1/2&#34; thick.  It is very colorful with lots of animals on the scene side that are labeled, some of which are ones you don't normally see on a child's toy (skunk, meercat, etc.).  When we put our son down on the mat for tummy time for the first time, he was mesmorized by the colors and texture in the mat.  The look on his face alone was worth the price.  The large mat is about 4.5' x 7' so it is large, but know that the scene on it is not one big scene with different animals, but the same scene repeated.  I could cut this mat in half and have two mats with the exact same picture.  Kind of annoying, but nothing that would stop me from using it.  The alphabet side is very colorful as well, although, to be honest, we have the animal scene side up for the most part so I haven't really spent too much time looking at it.I like that this mat gives my son a large, safer play area, and I look forward to seeing him learn to fall (during his learning to crawl/walk) on it.\n",

      "I have 15-month-old twins. Since starting them on solid foods, we've tried about a dozen different bibs from Safety 1st, Bumkins, Ikea, Tommee Tippee (our current favorite), and many other brands I don't recall because the bibs have been thrown away. The Bumkins bibs are better than average, but they're still not great.The tiny piece of velcro doesn't work to keep the bib on. My daughters figured out how to get these bibs off within a week of owning them. I tried for a while to use safety pins instead of the velcro, but it was hard to force the pin into the velcro/fabric, and awkward to have a sharp pin by the babies' necks Now, if I resort to using these bibs, I secure them in back with a bag-clip.The pocket caught about half the spilled food when the girls were just eating purees, but catches virtually nothing now that they're eating finger foods. So, spilled food just rolls down the bib and onto their clothes (and everything else).On the positive side, these bibs are completely washable (shockingly - to me at least - many other bibs aren't really washable and don't dry well -- we've thrown out many bibs because they smelled nasty despite washing & drying anyway we could). The pattern also doesn't wear off (again, this sounds like a low measure of success, but most bibs we've tried had ink that came off on the girls' clothing & hands within the first few uses).Overall, these aren't great -- but they're better than some alternatives.\n",

      "My wife has the large Bugaboo she uses all the time, but I needed a stroller for our one year old to keep in the trunk of my convertible (BMW M3).  This fit the bill.  It is light weight, fits easily in my tiny trunk and my daughter seems happy in it.  Does it have all of the bells and whistles the Bugaboo does?  Of course not.  Does it give me a place to put her when we are out running errands on the weekend.  Yes.I am fairly short (5'4\") and have absolutely no problem with the height of the handles.  My only complaint is that occassionally my feet will hit the rear wheels when walking.When folded, two wheels end up at the top and two at the bottom.  This means that if the wheels are dirty, there is no \"clean side.\"  Also, the dirty wheels will tend to make the sun visor dirty since they are in contact when folded.The buckle seems to work well although there is a velcro cover that folds over the buckle assembly from the outside in.  I'm not really sure what the purpose of it is, but I guess it keeps my daughter from opening the buckle herself - not that she has the hand strength necessary.Overall, for the reason I bought this, I am happy.  I would not recommend this as the only stroller you own, but is perfect for a second car or for grandma's house.\n",

      "This is a well-designed drying rack.  It holds a lot of stuff; you can really stack it up with no problems.  The curved arms make it so that I can even hang up my breast pump parts.  And since the design is vertical, doesn't take up a lot of room.  I already have a normal drying rack and a wine glass drying rack, so adding a third one was a little dicey, but this one fit in great.  I like that it spins, that it has a reservoir, and that you can remove the top portion from the reservoir to clean it out from time to time.  Haven't had any weird mold accumulation in the bottom because it is well-ventilated.  Bonus points for being easy to assemble and cute.  Overall very happy with this.  Couldn't do without it.\n",

      "We went for this because it saved a lot of width in the car. On that count, it delivers. It's significantly narrower than all the other competing models and we have 2 seats back that adults could sit in.Also, our little guy likes the seat, he will climb in by himself now.That being said, there are a lot of downsides:* It's heavy. Seriously. Don't believe those pictures with those happy people putting this thing on your back. You will not be a happy camper running through a large airport with this, especially keeping an eye on the children.* The installation instructions are HORRIBLE. I heard some stories about people taking a long time to set it up, and I thought \"rubbish! they're incompetent!\". Unfortunately, it's true. To start with, the installation is NOT fool-proof. There are many ways to seemingly hook it up. To add to the misery, the manual also sucks. It describes, more or less, the procedure. In words. Very few descriptive pictures. Unless you've done a few of these, yeah, I'd say be prepared to spend a good 30 min. trying to figure it out.* All those extra bolstering cushions. It's not obvious how to \"mount\" them and the instructions are virtually non-existent, so we ended up just storing them away. Summary? Go for the cheaper seat and forget about these.* In the rear-facing direction, the straight seat back does extend quite far forward, so you either have to place it in the middle, or hope that whoever sits in the front seat is short.* The installation again. The seat is tough to get straight in some locations. Really. In the middle, our seat is always tilted one way. I think it comes down to the strap that ties down the seat. For some unfathomable reason, it is tied to a strap (for storage?) that is riveted to one side of the seat. That strap is also a wee bit short, so when I yank the straps tight (as you're supposed to do), it also pulls down one side of the seat!* Shoulder straps. These are finicky. We figured out, and the salesperson also said as much, you have to pull it tight in many short jerks. On top of that issue, the straps often don't tighten evenly for some reason. That part we can't figure out since both straps our attached at the same point to the single pull strap...Would I recommend? Only if you really need the seat space offered by this narrow chair. Otherwise, the rest of the design, manual, ease-of-use, they quite SUCK when compared to the previous Graco that we owned. That was getting small, and yeah, it looked kind of \"cheapy\", but the installation was virtually fool proof and everything more or less works easily despite some minor useability gripes.\n",

      "Fairly easy to install.............built like a war horse for great protection to the little one.  The Britax YouTube video's are a great reference when installing the seat.  It took the wife a couple of days to really get the process down..........compared to the smaller b-safe seat that it replaced. She thinks the process is a little clumsy and the seat takes up a large amount of space, but overall not too bad.  I would buy again.\n",

      "I bought this Soundspa when my daughter turned one and didn't sleep as well at nap time. It did the trick - blocked out all the day noise and she slept well. We used it at night and for naps on a pretty quiet setting and turned it off each time. After about 5 weeks (just over the 30-day return deadline), I walked in to the heartbeat setting. That is the default and we kept it on rain or ocean. I figured the power went out as that always changed it. That night I went to turn it on and it changed to heartbeat while I was still in there rocking her. After about 30 min, she was crying. It totally died. I had to turn on a white noise app on my phone to get her to sleep. The next day I ran out and bought another. Again, just before the return deadline (I think 60 days at the store), it started acting up and quit working a day later. We switched to a different one and it worked when we needed it. After hearing that white noise may be bad for children's hearing, we weaned her off of it just before she turned 2 (turned the volume down a little each night until it was off).\n",

      "I was very interested to try this thirty-five-dollar concealer as I've been searching for one that met my needs. I'm disappointed by this one, unfortunately, although I had wanted to like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a generous pot of concealer, it will last a long time for the average user. The texture of the product is what got me, in that it does not apply well to under eye areas--despite the claim that this product is great for under eye areas and reduces winkles in said areas. I tried this concealer out in a variety of ways, using fingers to apply as well as a concealing brush. Note that the product suggests using a brush to dole out the product onto the back of your wrist, then from there to apply with the brush to your face.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say, I was pleased with how this product covered blemishes, quite well, when using a concealer brush. As for the undereye area? Which is big for me, as I'm a fair skinned lady of Swedish descent who has dark circles to cover, this product did not meet my expectations. It was hard and too dry to apply easily to the under-eye area well. Worse, I'd apply then move onto my foundation (which is quality product, Vincent Longo's Water Canvas Foundation) and this concealer would then gum up under my eyes. It didn't \"play well with others\" so to speak. When looking close up in the mirror, this product was OBVIOUS and easily seen on the eye. It didn't crease, but it \"gunked up\" on top of my skin and that I just cannot stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, it has a warm, yellowish tone, which is great if you're Asian but for a fair skinned Swede (with pink skin tones, not warm) it was just awful. This is what I can't understand about the beauty industry: every \"fair\" skinned product is made for warm skinned people. Meanwhile, there is a world of cool toned, Scandinavian skinned people out there needing COOL TONED products that the beauty industry is completely ignoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The texture was a miss as well, this product was just hard to apply well in that it is a hard creamy yet chalky consistency, like what you might find in a concealer stick that you twist to use. You can scoop it up on a brush, but as soon as it hits skin and air it starts drying and becomes difficult to smooth, I felt like I was smudging it onto my skin and this is not a pleasant thing when you're messing with delicate, under-eye skin. I really hate the texture of this concealer, overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I must say it did do well in covering up small red blemishes when applied with a small concealer brush. Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for ME, I do not get small red blemishes very often. So this product is very unhelpful overall, in my opinion. They would do well to 1) make a shade for cool toned fair skin and 2) create a product that is easily applied, this thick cream isn't cutting it and does not work--especially considering the claims they make for this product being good for the under-eye area as well as good for hiding tired, wrinkled eyes.\n",

      "I can't recommend it if needed for more than about 3 hours.  It does prolong makeup wear on hot, sweaty days for a couple of hours,  so it might work well for a photo shoot or short special event.  I would never wear it daily.\n",

      "\n",
      "Other than that, I have to say that the price point is excessive, because at the end of the day, using this isn't any different from spending less than a dollar to get a spray bottle, filling it with water, and misting your face. This is supposed to contain minerals and be beneficial to the skin, but I haven't noticed any kind of changes or benefits.
